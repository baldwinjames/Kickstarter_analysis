# Kickstarter Data Analysis 

This project takes a look at Kickstarter data from 2012 - 2017 and looks to uncover the answer to the following three questions:

1. What would be a realistic campaign goal for a company looking to make a Tabletop Game?
2. How many backers would the company need to obtain in order to hit their funding goal?
3. What's a realistic range of backers based on recent trends within the Tabletop category?

Data for this project was provided in 5 separate CSV files (campaign, category, sub_category, currency, country) which were first cleaned in Excel prior to being imported into PostgreSQL tables for analysis. 

After the queries were completed, a final CSV was exported and added to Tableau for visualizations.
